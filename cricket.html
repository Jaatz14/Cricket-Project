                Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played on a cricket field
                between two teams of eleven
                players each.[61] The field is usually circular or oval in shape and the edge of the playing area is
                marked
                by a boundary, which may be a fence, part of the stands, a rope, a painted line or a combination of
                these;
                the boundary must if possible be marked along its entire length.[62]

                In the approximate centre of the field is a rectangular pitch (see image, below) on which a wooden
                target
                called a wicket is sited at each end; the wickets are placed 22 yards (20 m) apart.[63] The pitch is a
                flat
                surface 10 feet (3.0 m) wide, with very short grass that tends to be worn away as the game progresses
                (cricket can also be played on artificial surfaces, notably matting). Each wicket is made of three
                wooden
                stumps topped by two bails.<br>
                The pitch is marked at each end with four white painted lines: a bowling crease, a popping crease and
                two return creases. The three stumps are aligned centrally on the bowling crease, which is eight feet
                eight inches long. The popping crease is drawn four feet in front of the bowling crease and parallel to
                it; although it is drawn as a twelve-foot line (six feet either side of the wicket), it is, in fact,
                unlimited in length. The return creases are drawn at right angles to the popping crease so that they
                intersect the ends of the bowling crease; each return crease is drawn as an eight-foot line, so that it
                extends four feet behind the bowling crease, but is also, in fact, unlimited in length.

                Before a match begins, the team captains (who are also players) toss a coin to decide which team will
                bat first and so take the first innings.[66] Innings is the term used for each phase of play in the
                match.[66] In each innings, one team bats, attempting to score runs, while the other team bowls and
                fields the ball, attempting to restrict the scoring and dismiss the batsmen.[67][68] When the first
                innings ends, the teams change roles; there can be two to four innings depending upon the type of match.
                A match with four scheduled innings is played over three to five days; a match with two scheduled
                innings is usually completed in a single day.[66] During an innings, all eleven members of the fielding
                team take the field, but usually only two members of the batting team are on the field at any given
                time. The exception to this is if a batsman has any type of illness or injury restricting his or her
                ability to run, in this case the batsman is allowed a runner who can run between the wickets when the
                batsman hits a scoring run or runs,[69] though this does not apply in international cricket.[70] The
                order of batsmen is usually announced just before the match, but it can be varied.<br>

                The main objective of each team is to score more runs than their opponents but, in some forms of
                cricket, it is also necessary to dismiss all of the opposition batsmen in their final innings in order
                to win the match, which would otherwise be drawn.[71] If the team batting last is all out having scored
                fewer runs than their opponents, they are said to have "lost by n runs" (where n is the difference
                between the aggregate number of runs scored by the teams). If the team that bats last scores enough runs
                to win, it is said to have "won by n wickets", where n is the number of wickets left to fall. For
                example, a team that passes its opponents' total having lost six wickets (i.e., six of their batsmen
                have been dismissed) have won the match "by four wickets".<br>

                In a two-innings-a-side match, one team's combined first and second innings total may be less than the
                other side's first innings total. The team with the greater score is then said to have "won by an
                innings and n runs", and does not need to bat again: n is the difference between the two teams'
                aggregate scores. If the team batting last is all out, and both sides have scored the same number of
                runs, then the match is a tie; this result is quite rare in matches of two innings a side with only 62
                happening in first-class matches from the earliest known instance in 1741 until January 2017. In the
                traditional form of the game, if the time allotted for the match expires before either side can win,
                then the game is declared a draw.[71]

                If the match has only a single innings per side, then a maximum number of overs applies to each innings.
                Such a match is called a "limited overs" or "one-day" match, and the side scoring more runs wins
                regardless of the number of wickets lost, so that a draw cannot occur. In some cases, ties are broken by
                having each team bat for a one-over innings known as a Super Over; subsequent Super Overs may be played
                if the first Super Over ends in a tie. If this kind of match is temporarily interrupted by bad weather,
                then a complex mathematical formula, known as the Duckworth–Lewis–Stern method after its developers, is
                often used to recalculate a new target score. A one-day match can also be declared a "no-result" if
                fewer than a previously agreed number of overs have been bowled by either team, in circumstances that
                make normal resumption of play impossible; for example, wet weather.[71]

                In all forms of cricket, the umpires can abandon the match if bad light or rain makes it impossible to
                continue.[72] There have been instances of entire matches, even Test matches scheduled to be played over
                five days, being lost to bad weather without a ball being bowled: for example, the third Test of the
                1970/71 series in Australia.

                The innings (ending with 's' in both singular and plural form) is the term used for each phase of play
                during a match. Depending on the type of match being played, each team has either one or two innings.
                Sometimes all eleven members of the batting side take a turn to bat but, for various reasons, an innings
                can end before they have all done so. The innings terminates if the batting team is "all out", a term
                defined by the Laws: "at the fall of a wicket or the retirement of a batsman, further balls remain to be
                bowled but no further batsman is available to come in".[66] In this situation, one of the batsmen has
                not been dismissed and is termed not out; this is because he has no partners left and there must always
                be two active batsmen while the innings is in progress.

                An innings may end early while there are still two not out batsmen:[66]

                the batting team's captain may declare the innings closed even though some of his players have not had a
                turn to bat: this is a tactical decision by the captain, usually because he believes his team have
                scored sufficient runs and need time to dismiss the opposition in their innings
                the set number of overs (i.e., in a limited overs match) have been bowled
                the match has ended prematurely due to bad weather or running out of time
                in the final innings of the match, the batting side has reached its target and won the game.

            <font>
                The Laws state that, throughout an innings, "the ball shall be bowled from each end alternately in overs
                of 6 balls".[74] The name "over" came about because the umpire calls "Over!" when six balls have been
                bowled. At this point, another bowler is deployed at the other end, and the fielding side changes ends
                while the batsmen do not. A bowler cannot bowl two successive overs, although a bowler can (and usually
                does) bowl alternate overs, from the same end, for several overs which are termed a "spell". The batsmen
                do not change ends at the end of the over, and so the one who was non-striker is now the striker and
                vice versa. The umpires also change positions so that the one who was at "square leg" now stands behind
                the wicket at the non-striker's end and vice versa.

                The bat is made of wood, usually Salix alba (white willow), and has the shape of a blade topped by a
                cylindrical handle. The blade must not be more than 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) wide and the total length of
                the bat not more than 38 inches (97 cm). There is no standard for the weight, which is usually between 2
                lb 7 oz and 3 lb (1.1 and 1.4 kg).[78][79]

                The ball is a hard leather-seamed spheroid, with a circumference of 9 inches (23 cm). The ball has a
                "seam": six rows of stitches attaching the leather shell of the ball to the string and cork interior.
                The seam on a new ball is prominent and helps the bowler propel it in a less predictable manner. During
                matches, the quality of the ball deteriorates to a point where it is no longer usable; during the course
                of this deterioration, its behaviour in flight will change and can influence the outcome of the match.
                Players will, therefore, attempt to modify the ball's behaviour by modifying its physical properties.
                Polishing the ball and wetting it with sweat or saliva is legal, even when the polishing is deliberately
                done on one side only to increase the ball's swing through the air, but the acts of rubbing other
                substances into the ball, scratching the surface or picking at the seam are illegal ball tampering

                Of the eleven fielders, three are in shot in the image above. The other eight are elsewhere on the
                field, their positions determined on a tactical basis by the captain or the bowler. Fielders often
                change position between deliveries, again as directed by the captain or bowler.<br>

                If a fielder is injured or becomes ill during a match, a substitute is allowed to field instead of him,
                but the substitute cannot bowl or act as a captain, except in the case of concussion substitutes in
                international cricket.[70] The substitute leaves the field when the injured player is fit to return.[82]
                The Laws of Cricket were updated in 2017 to allow substitutes to act as wicket-keepers

        <font color="black">Bowling and Dismissal</font>
    </h2>

    <h3>
        <p>
            <font>Most bowlers are considered specialists in that they are selected for the team because of their skill
                as a bowler, although some are all-rounders and even specialist batsmen bowl occasionally. The
                specialists bowl several times during an innings but may not bowl two overs consecutively. If the
                captain wants a bowler to "change ends", another bowler must temporarily fill in so that the change is
                not immediate.[74]

                A bowler reaches his delivery stride by means of a "run-up" and an over is deemed to have begun when the
                bowler starts his run-up for the first delivery of that over, the ball then being "in play".[74] Fast
                bowlers, needing momentum, take a lengthy run up while bowlers with a slow delivery take no more than a
                couple of steps before bowling. The fastest bowlers can deliver the ball at a speed of over 145
                kilometres per hour (90 mph) and they sometimes rely on sheer speed to try to defeat the batsman, who is
                forced to react very quickly.[85] Other fast bowlers rely on a mixture of speed and guile by making the
                ball seam or swing (i.e. curve) in flight. This type of delivery can deceive a batsman into miscuing his
                shot, for example, so that the ball just touches the edge of the bat and can then be "caught behind" by
                the wicket-keeper or a slip fielder.[85] At the other end of the bowling scale is the spin bowler who
                bowls at a relatively slow pace and relies entirely on guile to deceive the batsman. A spinner will
                often "buy his wicket" by "tossing one up" (in a slower, steeper parabolic path) to lure the batsman
                into making a poor shot. The batsman has to be very wary of such deliveries as they are often "flighted"
                or spun so that the ball will not behave quite as he expects and he could be "trapped" into getting
                himself out.[86] In between the pacemen and the spinners are the medium paced seamers who rely on
                persistent accuracy to try to contain the rate of scoring and wear down the batsman's concentration.[85]

                There are ten ways in which a batsman can be dismissed: five relatively common and five extremely rare.
                The common forms of dismissal are bowled,[87] caught,[88] leg before wicket (lbw),[89] run out[90] and
                stumped.[91] Rare methods are hit wicket,[92] hit the ball twice,[93] obstructing the field,[94] handled
                the ball[95] and timed out.[96] The Laws state that the fielding team, usually the bowler in practice,
                must appeal for a dismissal before the umpire can give his decision. If the batsman is out, the umpire
                raises a forefinger and says "Out!"; otherwise, he will shake his head and say "Not out".[97] There is,
                effectively, an eleventh method of dismissal, retired out, which is not an on-field dismissal as such
                but rather a retrospective one for which no fielder is credited.

                Batsmen take turns to bat via a batting order which is decided beforehand by the team captain and
                presented to the umpires, though the order remains flexible when the captain officially nominates the
                team.[61] Substitute batsmen are generally not allowed,[82] except in the case of concussion substitutes
                in international cricket.[70]

                In order to begin batting the batsman first adopts a batting stance. Standardly, this involves adopting
                a slight crouch with the feet pointing across the front of the wicket, looking in the direction of the
                bowler, and holding the bat so it passes over the feet and so its tip can rest on the ground near to the
                toes of the back foot.[99]

                A skilled batsman can use a wide array of "shots" or "strokes" in both defensive and attacking mode. The
                idea is to hit the ball to the best effect with the flat surface of the bat's blade. If the ball touches
                the side of the bat it is called an "edge". The batsman does not have to play a shot and can allow the
                ball to go through to the wicketkeeper. Equally, he does not have to attempt a run when he hits the ball
                with his bat. Batsmen do not always seek to hit the ball as hard as possible, and a good player can
                score runs just by making a deft stroke with a turn of the wrists or by simply "blocking" the ball but
                directing it away from fielders so that he has time to take a run. A wide variety of shots are played,
                the batsman's repertoire including strokes named according to the style of swing and the direction
                aimed: e.g., "cut", "drive", "hook", "pull".[100]

                The batsman on strike (i.e. the "striker") must prevent the ball hitting the wicket, and try to score
                runs by hitting the ball with his bat so that he and his partner have time to run from one end of the
                pitch to the other before the fielding side can return the ball. To register a run, both runners must
                touch the ground behind the popping crease with either their bats or their bodies (the batsmen carry
                their bats as they run). Each completed run increments the score of both the team and the striker.<br>
                The decision to attempt a run is ideally made by the batsman who has the better view of the ball's
                progress, and this is communicated by calling: usually "yes", "no" or "wait". More than one run can be
                scored from a single hit: hits worth one to three runs are common, but the size of the field is such
                that it is usually difficult to run four or more.[101] To compensate for this, hits that reach the
                boundary of the field are automatically awarded four runs if the ball touches the ground en route to the
                boundary or six runs if the ball clears the boundary without touching the ground within the boundary. In
                these cases the batsmen do not need to run.[102] Hits for five are unusual and generally rely on the
                help of "overthrows" by a fielder returning the ball. If an odd number of runs is scored by the striker,
                the two batsmen have changed ends, and the one who was non-striker is now the striker. Only the striker
                can score individual runs, but all runs are added to the team's total.[101]

                Additional runs can be gained by the batting team as extras (called "sundries" in Australia) due to
                errors made by the fielding side. This is achieved in four ways: no-ball, a penalty of one extra
                conceded by the bowler if he breaks the rules;[103] wide, a penalty of one extra conceded by the bowler
                if he bowls so that the ball is out of the batsman's reach;[104] bye, an extra awarded if the batsman
                misses the ball and it goes past the wicket-keeper and gives the batsmen time to run in the conventional
                way;[105] leg bye, as for a bye except that the ball has hit the batsman's body, though not his
                bat.[105] If the bowler has conceded a no-ball or a wide, his team incurs an additional penalty because
                that ball (i.e., delivery) has to be bowled again and hence the batting side has the opportunity to
                score more runs from this extra ball.

                The captain is often the most experienced player in the team, certainly the most tactically astute, and
                can possess any of the main skillsets as a batsman, a bowler or a wicket-keeper. Within the Laws, the
                captain has certain responsibilities in terms of nominating his players to the umpires before the match
                and ensuring that his players conduct themselves "within the spirit and traditions of the game as well
                as within the Laws".[61]

                The wicket-keeper (sometimes called simply the "keeper") is a specialist fielder subject to various
                rules within the Laws about his equipment and demeanour. He is the only member of the fielding side who
                can effect a stumping and is the only one permitted to wear gloves and external leg guards.[106]
                Depending on their primary skills, the other ten players in the team tend to be classified as specialist
                batsmen or specialist bowlers. Generally, a team will include five or six specialist batsmen and four or
                five specialist bowlers, plus the wicket-keeper.

                The game on the field is regulated by the two umpires, one of whom stands behind the wicket at the
                bowler's end, the other in a position called "square leg" which is about 15–20 metres away from the
                batsman on strike and in line with the popping crease on which he is taking guard. The umpires have
                several responsibilities including adjudication on whether a ball has been correctly bowled (i.e., not a
                no-ball or a wide); when a run is scored; whether a batsman is out (the fielding side must first appeal
                to the umpire, usually with the phrase "How's that?" or "Owzat?"); when intervals start and end; and the
                suitability of the pitch, field and weather for playing the game. The umpires are authorised to
                interrupt or even abandon a match due to circumstances likely to endanger the players, such as a damp
                pitch or deterioration of the light.[72]

                Off the field in televised matches, there is usually a third umpire who can make decisions on certain
                incidents with the aid of video evidence. The third umpire is mandatory under the playing conditions for
                Test and Limited Overs International matches played between two ICC full member countries. These matches
                also have a match referee whose job is to ensure that play is within the Laws and the spirit of the
                game.[72]

                The match details, including runs and dismissals, are recorded by two official scorers, one representing
                each team. The scorers are directed by the hand signals of an umpire (see image, right). For example,
                the umpire raises a forefinger to signal that the batsman is out (has been dismissed); he raises both
                arms above his head if the batsman has hit the ball for six runs. The scorers are required by the Laws
                to record all runs scored, wickets taken and overs bowled; in practice, they also note significant
                amounts of additional data relating to the game.[109]

                A match's statistics are summarised on a scorecard. Prior to the popularisation of scorecards, most
                scoring was done by men sitting on vantage points cuttings notches on tally sticks and runs were
                originally called notches.[110] According to Rowland Bowen, the earliest known scorecard templates were
                introduced in 1776 by T. Pratt of Sevenoaks and soon came into general use.[111] It is believed that
                scorecards were printed and sold at Lord's for the first time in 1846.
