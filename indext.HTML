        <h1> <em>Description of The Game</em></h1>
        Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval
        with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04
        metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across
        the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting and bowling
        (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides have one or two innings each, depending on
        the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball
        with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several
        ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an
        “over”), then a different player from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends
        its wicket.<br>
        There are various formats ranging from Twenty20, played over a few hours with each team batting for a single
        innings of 20 overs, to Test matches, played over five days with unlimited overs and the teams each batting for
        two innings of unlimited length. Traditionally cricketers play in all-white kit, but in limited overs cricket
        they wear club or team colours. In addition to the basic kit, some players wear protective gear to prevent
        injury caused by the ball, which is a hard, solid spheroid made of compressed leather with a slightly raised
        sewn seam enclosing a cork core which is layered with tightly wound string.<br>
        There are two batsman up at a time, and the batsman being bowled to (the striker) tries to hit the ball away
        from the wicket. A hit may be defensive or offensive. A defensive hit may protect the wicket but leave the
        batsmen no time to run to the opposite wicket. In that case the batsmen need not run, and play will resume with
        another bowl. If the batsman can make an offensive hit, he and the second batsman (the nonstriker) at the other
        wicket change places. Each time both batsmen can reach the opposite wicket, one run is scored. Providing they
        have enough time without being caught out and dismissed, the batsmen may continue to cross back and forth
        between the wickets, earning an additional run for each time both reach the opposite side. There is an outside
        boundary around the cricket field. A ball hit to or beyond the boundary scores four points if it hits the ground
        and then reaches the boundary, six points if it reaches the boundary from the air (a fly ball). The team with
        the highest number of runs wins a match. Should both teams be unable to complete their number of innings before
        the time allotted, the match is declared a draw. Scores in the hundreds are common in cricket.
